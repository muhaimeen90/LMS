    statement: "The Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon with the naked eye.",
    isTrue: false,
    explanation: "This is a common myth. The Great Wall of China is not visible from the Moon with the naked eye. In fact, it's barely visible from low Earth orbit, and only under perfect conditions. From the Moon, it would be completely invisible without powerful telescopes."

  {
    id: "fact2",
    statement: "Water always boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit).",
    isTrue: false,
    explanation: "Water's boiling point varies depending on atmospheric pressure. At sea level, water boils at 100째C (212째F), but at higher altitudes (lower pressure), it boils at lower temperatures. For example, on Mount Everest, water boils at about 71째C (160째F)."

  {
    id: "fact3",
    statement: "Humans use only 10% of their brains.",
    isTrue: false,
    explanation: "This is a persistent myth with no scientific basis. Modern neuroimaging technology shows that all parts of the brain have active functions, and while not all neurons fire simultaneously, most regions of the brain are active during daily tasks."
  },
  {
    id: "fact4",
    statement: "Earth's rotation around its axis causes day and night cycles.",
    isTrue: true,
    explanation: "This is correct. Earth rotates on its axis, making one complete rotation approximately every 24 hours. The side facing the Sun experiences daytime, while the side facing away experiences nighttime."
  },
  {
    id: "fact5",
    statement: "Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth.",
    isTrue: true, 
    explanation: "This is true. Diamond is the hardest known natural material, ranking 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. It's made of carbon atoms arranged in a crystal structure, which gives it exceptional hardness and thermal conductivity."
  },
  {
    id: "fact6",
    statement: "Lightning never strikes the same place twice.",
    isTrue: false,
    explanation: "Lightning frequently strikes the same place multiple times. Tall buildings like the Empire State Building are struck dozens of times annually. Lightning seeks the path of least resistance, so objects that are good conductors and located at high elevations are prone to repeated strikes."
  },
  {
    id: "fact7",
    statement: "The color of blood in your veins is blue when inside the body.",
    isTrue: false,
    explanation: "Blood is always red. Oxygenated blood is bright red, while deoxygenated blood appears darker red. The bluish appearance of veins is due to how light penetrates skin and is reflected, not the color of the blood itself."
  },
  {
    id: "fact8",
    statement: "A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.",
    isTrue: true,
    explanation: "This is true. Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation (a Venusian day), while it orbits the Sun in about 225 Earth days (a Venusian year). This means a day on Venus is longer than its year."
  },
  {
    id: "fact9",
    statement: "If you cut an earthworm in half, both halves will survive and grow into separate worms.",
    isTrue: false,
    explanation: "While earthworms can regenerate some parts of their body, they cannot survive being cut in half. If cut behind the clitellum (the thick band), the front half may survive and regenerate a tail, but the back half will die. If cut in front of the clitellum, both halves typically die."
  },
  {
    id: "fact10",
    statement: "The human body contains enough carbon to make about 9,000 pencils.",
    isTrue: true,
    explanation: "This is approximately correct. About 18-19% of the human body is carbon by mass. For an average adult weighing 70kg, that's about 14kg of carbon, which could indeed produce roughly 9,000 pencil leads, depending on the size and composition of the pencils."
